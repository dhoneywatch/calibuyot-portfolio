This tool deploys Machine Learning models to classify the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level and predict the patientâ€™s Length of Stay (LOS) in the Emergency Department (ED). Designed for medical and nursing students, PredictED aids in quick and accurate triage, decision-making, and resource preparation amidst ED overcrowding and bed shortages. It allows users to input relevant triage data and provides the predicted ESI level, explanations from Explainable AI, and the potential LOS.",
